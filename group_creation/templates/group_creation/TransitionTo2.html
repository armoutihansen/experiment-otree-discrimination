		<li> We have now divided you and the rest of the participants into two groups based on your
			expressed preferences over the two artists, Klee and Kandinsky, whose paintings you
			saw.</li>
		<li> Relative to the others, you have a preference for paintings by {{ group }}. Therefore, you have been assigned to the {{ group }} group. </li>
		<li> The two groups will remain the same for the rest of the experiment. </li>
		<li> The number of individuals in your own group is {{ group_players }}.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Now, we will allow you to interact with your group members to solve a task. How well you do
	will depend on your groupâ€™s ability to cooperate effectively.</p>
